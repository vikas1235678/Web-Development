<h1>Passengers stranded as Kerala-bound trains run late</h1>
<p>Thousands of passengers in Kerala were left stranded as five express trains were running late by at least two hours.
The Chennai-Thiruvananthapuram SF Express was late by seven hours. It was scheduled to leave Chennai Central at 3:25 pm on Sunday but could begin its journey only at 8:34 pm.

Railway officials said the trains are delayed due to an ongoing maintenance work at Arakkonam yard in the Chennai-Palakkad-Thiruvananthapuram route.
However, trains on other routes are also running late.
The Malabar Express running between Mangalore Central and Thiruvananthapuram is delayed by more than six hours. The train was scheduled to start from Mangalore at 6:15 pm on Sunday but left the station at 12:50 am on Monday.
At the time of filing this story, the train was running late by over seven hours. Railway officials reasoned that the delay is caused because empty coaches of Chennai-Mangalore Mail are used to run the Malabar Express.
Since the former was delayed by over 10 hours, the latter too had to be delayed, they said.
Besides these, people are also inconvenienced because even long-distance trains are running late in the state. The Korba-Thiruvananthapuram Express is running late by four hours.
The delayed trains also impact the movement of those running on time due to congestion on tracks and passage time.
On the other hand, the maintenance work at Arakkonam was scheduled to be completed by Sunday. However, it is likely to take some more days to complete.</p>
